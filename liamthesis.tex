\begin{abstract} % At most 350 words for Ph.D.
The time-variable long-wavelength sky harbours a 
number of known but unsolved astrophysical problems, 
and surely many more undiscovered phenomena.
With modern tools such problems will become tractable, 
and new classes of astronomical objects will be revealed.
These tools include digital radio telescopes made from 
powerful computing clusters, improved data analytics and 
statistical inference, and theoretical methods. In this 
thesis we employ all of these tools to understand better 
several puzzles in the time-domain radio sky. Our primary 
focus is on the origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), a 
new class of transients of which there seem to be 
thousands per sky per day. We offer a model in which 
FRBs are extragalactic but non-cosmological pulsars 
in very young supernova remnants. Since this theoretical 
work was done, several lines of observational evidence 
have corroborated the picture of FRBs as young rotating neutron 
stars, including the non-Poissonian repetition of FRB 121102.
We also present statistical arguments regarding the nature 
and location of the bursts. These include reinstituting 
the classic $V/V_{\rm max}$-test to measure the brightness 
distribution of FRBs, i.e., constraining  
$\frac{\partial \log N}{\partial \log S}$.
In contrast to other claims in the 
literature, we find consistency with a Euclidean distribution. 
This means current observations cannot distinguish between 
a cosmological population and a more local uniform 
population, unless added assumptions are made. We 
also showed that the rate of FRBs below L-band is consistent
with the rate at 1.4\,GHz, which is promising for upcoming 
high-impact experiments. One of these is 
the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME).
We outline this instrument and its three back-ends: 
a cosmology experiment whose goal is to measure dark 
energy through 21\,cm intensity mapping, a pulsar 
back-end, and an FRB project that is expected to be 
by far the fastest survey in the foreseeable future.
We describe the creation 
of a digital beamforming back-end on the CHIME Pathfinder, 
which acts as a test-bed for the three final experiments just 
described. 
We also discuss the commissioning of a 24/7 real-time VLBI 
FRB search between the Pathfinder's 
synthetic beam and the Algonquin Radio Observatory (ARO)
46\,m telescope. This includes results from the first couple of
months on sky. Finally, we present a study of 
the microstructure in pulsar B0329+54's individual pulses 
in full-polarization and present results on the quasi-periodic 
structure seen in almost all pulses.

% \begin{acknowledgements}
%    The research presented in this thesis samples the work 
%    I have done over the last five years, which has 
%    ranged from what felt like mathematical musings to software development  
%    to on-site hardware work. This is because both of my supervisors, 
%    Ue-Li Pen and Keith Vanderlinde, possess end-to-end knowledge 
%    and understanding that has at times left me awe-stricken; 
%    needless to say this thesis would not have been possible without them. 
%    A similarly insightful supervisory figure was Richard Shaw, 
%    whose ease with signal processing, statistics, and computing 
%    was greatly appreciated in my first couple years of graduate school. 
%    On the CHIME team, I was lucky enough to work closely 
%    with such world-class experimental cosmologists as Mark Halpern 
%    and Gary Hinshaw. Tom Landecker was an irreplaceable source 
%    of knowledge and wisdom during my many 
%    visits to DRAO, acting as the token radio astronomer in a 
%    large radio astronomy project. I also thank the members of my 
%    thesis committee, including Mike Reid and Barth Netterfield. 
%    To the four other remaining Ph.D. candidates in my year,
%    Heidi, Lauren, Max, and Stephen, it's been a pleasure. I'll 
%    never forget moving into the astro library with you guys 
%    in order to sweat over quals. To my external friends, Malcolm,
%    Geoff, NELLA, Tom, Riley, Pete, and Nick, I appreciate the tacit 
%    support and your expertly feigned disinterest in the particulars 
%    of my research. It allowed for much-needed compartmentalization 
%    and enabled me to genuinely enjoy my mid-twenties in Toronto. 
%    Layla, thank you for grounding me and expanding my world.
%    Finally, I thank my family. Mom and dad, the goodness of your 
%    parenting precluded me from 
%    making a career in painting, poetry, or literature, since I 
%    would have no right to claim myself a tortured artist. Pop, 
%    your intellectual curiosity and sense of humour 
%    at the age of (at the time of this writing) ninety one, 
%    is truly inspiring. Alastair, Reegan, and Sophie, thank you 
%    as well for the support over these last five years.
